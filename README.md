Example for Threagile:

# Description

- **As** a Software Engineer,
- **I want to** identify and report security vulnerabilities according to the OWASP Top Ten,
- **So that** I can ensure the application is secure and compliant with industry standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Vulnerability Identification

- **Given** the Threagile Docker container is deployed,
- **When** a scan is initiated on the code repository,
- **Then** the system must identify and list vulnerabilities from the OWASP Top Ten.

2. Reporting Mechanism

- **Given** vulnerabilities have been identified,
- **When** the engineer generates a report,
- **Then** the report must detail each vulnerability, including severity levels and remediation suggestions.

3. User Interface

- **Given** the engineer accesses the reporting interface,
- **When** navigating through the vulnerabilities,
- **Then** the interface must allow filtering by type and severity.

4. Notification System

- **Given** new vulnerabilities are detected,
- **When** the scan completes,
- **Then** the engineer must receive notifications via email or Bitbucket alerts.

5. Compliance Check

- **Given** the report is generated,
- **When** reviewing the report,
- **Then** it must indicate whether the application meets compliance standards based on identified vulnerabilities.

6. Export Options

- **Given** the engineer has generated a report,
- **When** selecting export options,
- **Then** the report must be available in multiple formats (e.g., PDF, CSV).

7. Integration

- **Given** the Threagile service is running,
- **When** the engineer connects it to Bitbucket,
- **Then** the tool must seamlessly integrate into the existing development workflows.
